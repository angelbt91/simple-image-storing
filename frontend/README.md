# Frontend

This frontend was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Start the app

Just run:

`> yarn start`

In order to work properly, the app expects the backend to be listening on `localhost:3001/upload`. Check the `/backend` folder to get instructions on how to start the backend service.
